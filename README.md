# Hi, I’m Kimon Sylaios

Cybersecurity Consultant at **NVISO (Strategy & Architecture)**, based in **Thessaloniki, Greece**. I design and review secure architectures across networks, identity (AD), segmentation, incident response, and backup/restore - so systems stay resilient when things get noisy.

Currently building **Command‑Zero** (practice tests for CISSP/Security+/CCNA) and shipping side projects like **Oceancast** and **metoceanTRAVEL**.

**CISSP | Security+ | Network+**  
If you want to talk security architecture, IR playbooks, or “how do we recover fast?”, let’s connect.
