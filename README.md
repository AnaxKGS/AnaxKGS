# Hey there! 👋 I'm Kimon

> *Currently caffeinated on freddo espresso and architecting secure networks in Thessaloniki* ☕

## What I Do
🏢 **Cybersecurity Consultant** at [NVISO Security](https://www.nviso.eu/) - Strategy & Architecture Department  
🛡️ The go-to person for backup & restore (because someone has to think about when things go wrong)  
🏗️ I redesign architectures, assess networks & Active Directory, and write playbooks that hopefully people actually read  

## Current Mission
📚 Studying for **CISSP** (because apparently Net+ and Sec+ weren't enough suffering)  
🎯 Building [**CommandZero**](https://command-zero.com) - Free practice tests for Security+, CISSP, and other certs  
*Because expensive prep materials are the real security threat*

## When I'm Not Securing Things
🎸 Playing classical guitar (badly, but with passion)  
💪 At the gym (trying to lift my way out of imposter syndrome)  
☕ Perfecting the art of cold coffee - freddo espresso and frappé are life  

## Education & Certs
🎓 **MEng in Electrical & Computer Engineering**  
📜 **CompTIA Network+** & **Security+**  
🎯 **CISSP** (in progress - send good vibes)

## Fun Facts
🇬🇷 Based in Thessaloniki, Greece  
🔐 I believe in defense in depth... for everything (including coffee preparation)  
📖 My playbooks are 50% technical documentation, 50% dad jokes  
🎵 Can play Bach but still struggle with network ACLs sometimes
